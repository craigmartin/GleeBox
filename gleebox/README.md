#GleeBox
##GleeBox is a DropBox clone developed first with RoR 3.2.1 for prototyping
###As I progress in the development I plan to transition much functionality into services with API public facing.
####I will also add a node.js server to add asynch functions/and for fun. ;-)
- The purpose is for my own internal use for several apps I am building as well as a few clients to use.

##ToDo:
1.) Finish RoR prototype.
2.) Convert some functions to Gems or Engines where appropriate.
3.) Transition to services and build out API.
4.) Add events functions.
